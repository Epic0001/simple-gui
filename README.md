# Blook Script GUI

### What is this?
This is an experimental branch of Blooket Cheats that use a custom compiler and runtime to get around Blooket's CSP eval block but with a gui
Not stylish GUI :( but everything works 



### What's the benefits?
* No more manually updating cheats!
* Firefox users no longer have to worry about the max bookmark limit
* All cheats can now be ran by the same script, just by changing one value

### How do I get started?
If you like to use the Devtools console, copy the script found in [gui.js](/gui.js), or if you like or can only use bookmarks, idk how to do
